                    <p class="text-justify">This course starts at a true beginner level which allowed me to follow the course very easily. 
                        As you can see from the outline, this course is divided into 6 parts and covers a broad range of topics ranging from total 
                        beginner=level basics to machine learning and GUI.
                        <uo>
                            <li>Part 1 which deals with basic concepts on variables and matrices can be learned faster 
                                using more text-based resources. Anybody with even a minimal familiary with the coding 
                                may find the Part1 few lectures slow. </li>
                            <li>
                                Part2 covers data structures. Prior to this lecture, I had zero knowledge on different types of data and how they are stored
                                so I found Part 2 very helpful.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Part3, 4 covers Machine Leaning but I (along side many others) would much rather recommend Andrew Ng's course on Coursera which 
                                goes through much more in-depth theoretical concepts behind machine learning (or better still get a book). What this course is good at 
                                is that it guides you through setting up a ML template with MATLAB and explores some of the ML functions already available in MATLAB so 
                                you can apply them right away. However, if you want to learn more than a few MATLAB ML tricks, you would definitely need other resources. 
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Part5 gives a good overview of Regular Expressions. This was the first time I was learning about regular 
                                expressions so I liked doing the exercises, but again this was one of the topics that I think someone could 
                                have gone through a lot faster with a reference webpage, rather than a video lecture. 
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                This lecture's last topic is on GUI which I think was a good lesson if you want to learn how to make a GUI app with MATLAB.
                                After a couple of tweaking with a few items on the GUI, you can easily pick up the idea of how to customize your own app.  
                            </li>
                            
                            Overall, I think this was a good introductory MATLAB course for total beginners who prefer video lectures to keep them motivated.
